# Coding Style Guidelines

These coding style guidelines are intended to ensure consistency and readability in our project's codebase. All contributors should follow these guidelines when writing code for this project.

## 1. Code Formatting

- Use spaces for indentation, not tabs.
- Use a consistent number of spaces for indentation (e.g., 2 or 4 spaces).
- Keep lines under a reasonable length (e.g., 80-120 characters) for readability.

## 2. Naming Conventions

- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `myVariable`, `calculateValue()`).
- Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., `MyClass`).
- Use uppercase letters and underscores for constants (e.g., `MAX_VALUE`).
- Avoid single-letter variable names unless used for short iterations (e.g., `for (let i = 0; i < length; i++)`).

## 3. Comments

- Use comments to explain complex code, algorithms, or any non-obvious logic.
- Write comments in English and use clear, concise language.
- Keep comments up to date when code changes.
- Avoid excessive commenting on obvious or self-explanatory code.

## 4. Documentation

- Include a clear and concise [README.md](../README.md) file in each project repository.
- Document public functions, classes, and modules using JSDoc or equivalent.
- Explain the purpose, parameters, return values, and usage of functions and classes.

## 5. Imports

- Group import statements in the following order:
  1. Core Node.js modules
  2. Third-party modules
  3. Local project modules

Example:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const express = require('express');
const myModule = require('./myModule');
```

## 6. Indentation

Use the chosen indentation style consistently throughout the codebase.
Use spaces for alignment in code blocks when necessary for readability.

## 7. Miscellaneous

Remove unnecessary console.log statements and debugging code before committing.
Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by avoiding duplicated code.
Follow the project's code of conduct and contributing guidelines.
Please adhere to these coding style guidelines to maintain a clean and consistent codebase. Consistency makes it easier for contributors to understand and work on the code, leading to better collaboration and maintainability.
